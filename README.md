# Skill It Up
### Overview:

A [Code:You](https://code-you.org/) capstone project building a custom API while applying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

### Project Overview:

Many cooking applications assume their users possess a certain level of cooking acumen and lack opportunities to personally track the cooking process. This project addresses organization of the cooking process, as well as offers opportunities to learn skills and cooking terms through execution of the recipe. This application also allows users to share recipes to the website.
