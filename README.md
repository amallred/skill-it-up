Focus on proper semantic HTML
Application of variables for consistent formatting (imported fonts, colors, box shadow, etc.)
Intentional layout of CSS styling


TO DO:
- Hamburger menu
  - in progress; https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_mobile_navbar.asp 
- add hover & click interactions with buttons
- look up how to automatically make columns based on list length for ingredients
- Link headers and footers across the site
- Make a logo
  - using an svg is proving very difficult; I resaved as png for now
