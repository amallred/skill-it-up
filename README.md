# Skill It Up
Overview:

A Code:You capstone project building a custom API while applying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

Project Overview:

Many cooking applications assume their users possess a certain level of cooking acumen and lack opportunities to personally track the cooking process. This project addresses organization of the cooking process, from ingredient gathering to serving, as well as offers opportunities to learn skills and cooking terms through execution of the recipe. This application also allows users to share recipes.
